# Academic Research Tool

A comprehensive platform designed to help students and researchers discover, analyze, and manage academic papers efficiently.

## Overview

This project is a tool that helps students and researchers find and understand academic papers. Users enter a topic or question, and the system retrieves papers using APIs such as Semantic Scholar. It ranks papers by relevance using embeddings and provides concise GPT reports that explain each paper's content and its relation to the user's queryâ€”whether it supports, contradicts, or forms a foundation for the topic.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
